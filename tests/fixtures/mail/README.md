# Mail fixtures

These JSON envelopes are synthetic and manually minimized from observed iCloud
Mail HTTP capture shapes. All identifiers, contacts, headers, dates, and message
contents are invented. No raw captures, cookies, signed URLs, or binary files
are included. Binary download tests use mocked bytes.

Load these fixtures through `tests.fixture_loader.load_fixture` so reads respect
the test filesystem sandbox. Search results are thread-grouped; listing fixtures
represent bounded snapshots, not a complete synchronization protocol.

`preview_response.json` and `thread_filter_response.json` are minimized synthetic
shapes derived from user-authorized browser captures on 2026-10-19. Preview
identifiers, GUIDs, snippets, group IDs, timestamps, counts, and modification
sequences are invented. Thread-filter results are groups, not per-message flag
matches; the fixtures do not establish combined-filter or sync semantics.
